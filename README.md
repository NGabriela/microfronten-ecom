## Types of files generated by webpack:

main.js - created on normal build, allows running project standalone 

remoteEntry.js - generated by MFP, list of files available from project and loading instructions 

src_index.js - a processed version of index.js + dependencies ( that can be run in the browser)

vendors...faker.js - a processed version of faker lib ( that can be run in the browser)

## Project structure

- index.js and bootstrap.js are both required in container because it allows webpack to load dependencies before executing the code (inside bootstrap.js)
